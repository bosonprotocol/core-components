# Buyer and Seller Agreement

The following agreement (the “**Agreement**") is entered into by and between you (the “**Buyer**”) and the Seller, and sets out the terms relating to a transaction whereby:

- A) The Seller offers its products or services for sale through a Redeemable NFT  (the “**rNFT**”), which can be redeemed for the Item. 

- B) The Buyer redeems the rNFT from the Seller to obtain the Item.

- C) The Buyer agrees to obtain and the Seller agrees to provide the Item on the terms set out in this Agreement.

The Seller and the Buyer hereinafter collectively referred to as the “**Parties**” and each individually as a “**Party**”.

## (A) About Boson Protocol

As Web3’s Commerce Layer, Boson Protocol enables the tokenization, transfer and trade of any physical thing as a Redeemable NFT. 

## (B) How Boson Protocol works

### Offer Creation

The Seller creates an Offer to sell an Item at a particular price, sets the Cancellation Penalty and the Seller Deposit, the Offer Validity Period, and the Redemption Period.

The Seller puts the Seller Deposit into the seller pool that is locked in a smart contract.

The Seller unilaterally appoints a Dispute Resolver (the “**DR**”). Once the DR is appointed, it  cannot be changed by the Seller after the Offer Creation stage. 

### Committing to an Offer

The Buyer reviews the Offer details and commits to the Offer by depositing the Item Price that is locked in the smart contract.

The Buyer receives the rNFT in its wallet address.

### Revoking a Voucher 

The Seller can revoke a rNFT after the Buyer has committed to an Offer, as a result forfeiting their Seller Deposit and allowing the Buyer to withdraw their payment and the Seller Deposit. The Buyer can withdraw the funds left immediately after the Seller has revoked.‍

### Cancelling a Voucher

The Buyer can cancel a rNFT after committing to an Offer, as a result forfeiting their Cancellation Penalty, but getting a refund of the funds left, which is the Item Price less the Cancellation Penalty. The Buyer can withdraw the funds left immediately after the cancellation. If there is a subsequent / secondary sale and the holder of the rNFT cancels the rNFT, the holder of the rNFT can only withdraw the funds that are locked in the smart contract.

### Redeem a Voucher

‍The Buyer can redeem a rNFT within the Redemption Period, which specifies the point in time at which the rNFT expires and can no longer be exchanged for the relevant Items. If the Buyer does not redeem the rNFT before the Redemption Period is over, they are deemed to have cancelled the commitment.

### AGREED TERMS

1. Redemption
   1. To redeem the rNFT, the Buyer shall:
      1. read, understand and accept the additional terms of sale within the Seller’s Shop Policy (Exhibit A).
      2. provide the contact information and the delivery details to Seller using the Seller Contact Method.

2. Fulfillment
   1. When the Buyer redeems the rNFT, the Seller will have the Item delivered within the Delivery Timeframe. 

3. Dispute Resolution
   1. If the Offer is not fulfilled in accordance with the Agreement and the Seller’s Shop Policy (Exhibit A), the Buyer can raise a complaint (the “**Dispute**”), which triggers the transaction to be set to the **Dispute State**. The Buyer must raise the complaint before the Dispute Period ends.
   2. The Buyer and the Seller shall attempt to resolve the Dispute mutually by communicating via the Seller Contact Method. They may agree to a split of the Deposit Pool. If an agreement is reached, one party (Buyer or Seller) signs a message which indicates the agreed-upon split. The other party uploads the decision on-chain and moves the Dispute to the **Resolved State** allowing Buyer and Seller to withdraw their payoff accordingly.
   3. The dispute must be mutually resolved within the Resolution Period. The Seller can extend the Resolution Period. If the dispute has not moved to the Resolved State  and no time extension is given before the Resolution Period is over, then the dispute is moved to the **Retracted State** and the transaction is completed.
   4. Buyer can unilaterally move the dispute to the Retracted State, or submit the dispute on-chain for decision to the nominated DR together with the Escalation Deposit, which then moves the Dispute to the “**Escalated State**”.
   5. Following escalation, the DR communicates with Buyer and Seller off-chain to seek facts about the dispute and reviews them against the terms of the transaction (per the decision tree and specifications below). Following the submission of evidence, if any, by the Parties, the DR provides a decision about the split of the Deposit Pool by triggering an on-chain transaction (the “**Decided State**”). Buyer and Seller can then withdraw their payoff according to DR’s decision.
