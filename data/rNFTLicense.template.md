# Redeemable NFT Terms

By purchasing the Redeemable Non-Fungible Token (“rNFT”)<sup>*</sup> at the primary point of sale, the Primary Buyer becomes the beneficiary of the following terms (“Terms”) so long as the Primary Buyer is holding the rNFT. Once the token is transferred to a third party, any subsequent holders of the rNFT will become the beneficiary of the Terms.

The rNFT entitles its holder(s):
- to transfer and sell the rNFT to any third party;
- to redeem the rNFT as long as the redemption is within the Redemption Period and in accordance with the terms published by the Seller and coded into the rNFT; 
- to Cancel the rNFT and receive in exchange the Item Price minus the Cancellation Penalty, where the Item Price is the price originally paid by the Primary Buyer, and not the price paid for the rNFT on the secondary market.

If the holder of the rNFT does not redeem the rNFT before the Redemption Period is over, the holder will no longer be able to benefit from the associated Terms. Instead, upon the Cancel function being called, the current holder of the rNFT will be able to withdraw the funds (i.e. the Item Price minus the Cancellation Penalty).

By redeeming the rNFT within the Redemption Period and having received from the Seller the seller's information as required by laws applicable to the Buyer, the holder of the rNFT is deemed to have agreed to the Buyer & Seller Agreement (See the link to the agreement below).

<p align=center><em><sup>*</sup>It is important to note that an rNFT is a voucher that can be redeemed for a digital and/or physical good and it is subject to the rNFTs T&Cs and it is NOT a digital representation of said good.</em></p>
